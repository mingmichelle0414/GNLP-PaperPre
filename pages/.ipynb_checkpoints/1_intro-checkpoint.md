## 📌 Existing Approaches in Embodied AI Environment Creation

- 🎨 **Manual Design**: Handcrafted 3D scenes created by artists  
    ⚠️ **Challenges**: Expensive, Labor-intensive and slow production  

- 📸 **3D Scanning**: Captures real-world scenes through scanning  
⚠️ **Challenges**: Limited interactivity and customization  

- ⚙️ **Procedural Generation** (e.g., PROCTHOR): Uses rule-based algorithms to generate environments    
⚠️ **Challenges**: Rigid layouts with limited fine-grained detail  

- 🖼️ **2D-to-3D Model Adaptation**: Converts 2D images into 3D scenes   
⚠️ **Challenges**: Prone to artifacts and unrealistic results

## LLM’s Role in Scene Generation 🚀🤖

- **Abstract-to-Concrete Mapping 🎨**  
  **Input:** "a spa with large hot tubs and massage tables"  
  **Output:** LLM translates this abstract concept into detailed scene elements (e.g., specific models, spatial arrangements)  

- **Common Sense Knowledge 💡**  
  Automatically includes expected items (e.g., musical instruments 🎹 in a music room)

- **Interactivity 💬**  
  Allows dynamic adjustments of parameters (e.g., color, position) through dialogue

- **Spatial Reasoning 🏠**  
  Understands physical relationships (e.g., cups on tables ☕, objects adjacent to each other)
  Uses spatial constraints and a solver to optimize layouts, ensuring realistic scene compositions.
